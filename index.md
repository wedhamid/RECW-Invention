## Abstract
The Remote Energy Convergence Weapon (RECW) is a theoretical concept of a longâ€‘range, nonâ€‘projectile weapon that uses **synchronized wave interference** to deliver destructive energy at a distance. By focusing multiple waveforms (e.g. electromagnetic, acoustic) to converge at a precise point, the system can create explosion, heat, or vibrational resonance effectsâ€”without any visible beam or projectile.
